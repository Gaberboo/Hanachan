# Hanachan

A reimplementation of the physics engine of Mario Kart Wii, aiming for perfectly accurate ghost replay. The initial goal is to reach 100% coverage of the CTGP database on Nintendo tracks.

## Status

At the moment, it is possible to replay a very simple rMC3 ghost for 411 frames (that is, until the actual start of the race).

## Future plans

* 200cc
* Custom tracks
* Multiplayer mechanics
* Advanced ghost analysis and statistics
* Graphics reimplementation using Vulkan
* Full game reimplementation (maybe)

## Contributing

At the moment, the codebase is evolving very fast and there is still some code I haven't integrated yet, so if you want to contribute non-trivial features, please tell me about it so we can properly coordinate.

## Resources

Note: the vast majority of research and development happens on the PAL version of the game.
